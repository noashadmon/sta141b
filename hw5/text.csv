1,"Wells Fargo faces fraud, predatory lending charges, other controversies
The University of California (UC) will retract a $300 million line of credit and a $150 million interest reset contract with Wells Fargo by April of this year. $200 million has already been retracted, and the remaining $100 million will be divested after a replacement bank is found. This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. 
In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. Federal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created two million fraudulent bank and credit accounts under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.
 Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. 
Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.
Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos  it settled with the Justice Department for $184.3 million in 2012. 
Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the environmental sustainability officer of the UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.
We came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline, Ferreyra said. These oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they dont care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. Divestment is a historically successful tactic.
On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also ended its contract with Wells Fargo. It will be moving $124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from Wells Fargo on the same day.
Over the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community, Mayor Robb Davis said.
Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking  they are another factor in the councils decision to divest.
Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the universitys rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.
UC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo, Doan wrote via email. However, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.
Connor Gorman, a UC student workers union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was the schools driving force in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. 
The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.
 By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system, a post on the ABC website read. We dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in Americas gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.
Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.
Since the 1970s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of Californias mission to be a world-class public research university system, Pulido said. And we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our countrys ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our companys ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials. 
Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.
Wells Fargo is a bank, Pulido said. We do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we dont tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we dont tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. We have no seat on either companys board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models."
2,"Faculty, students recount personal tales of immigration; highlight value of diversity
UC Davis students, faculty and members of the Davis community gathered on the Quad on Feb. 9 to display their solidarity with those directly affected by President Donald Trumps immigration ban.
In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of Academics United  No Visa and Immigration Ban. Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White  both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association  were the organizers of this peaceful rally.
The event was approximately an hour long, d
uring which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as Love not hate makes the nation great and No ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear. It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including Fox 40 and CBS Sacramento.
Akrami said that her goal for the event was to start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.
The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled My Home Towns Are Home to the World.
In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of proclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city and welcoming people from all over the world.
They have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom, Davis said. This affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.
Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.
Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for following a path that leads to a better world.
Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain love and compassion in such politically turbulent and tense times.
Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellors Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.
Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.
White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.
In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the fading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers and how they may not have the chance to be safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities. 
On a lighter note, he concluded with having immense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.
UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.
As an Iranian, its heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on, Mostafavi said."
3,"Opening date pushed back to May 1
Students have awaited the full reopening of the Memorial Union (MU) for almost two years since its closure in early 2015. Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.
We had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd, said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. However, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.
Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a ceremonial grand opening. Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.
A ceremonial grand opening will take place, Fucile said. Planning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).
Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.
I will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU, Secor said via email. These new spaces are reminiscent of the buildings original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.
Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.
I have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which Ive never experienced, Santamaria said. I have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [] the seating area, that sounds really nice. Youre always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think its just something thats really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.
Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. "
4,"Veto included revision abandoning creation of oversight committee for judicial council
Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).

 Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.

 ASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court, Flores wrote in the amendment. Given the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Councils ruling.

 The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. 

 Lees revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.

 I am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant, Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. If it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.

 In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.
 Allowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review, Lee said. What is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.
 Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.

 Basically, I didnt agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee, Molodanof said via email. I wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didnt like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial boards job is to act as a check). It didnt really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).
 Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCDs judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.
"
5,"Shaheens name to remain on ballot, his votes will not be counted
Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD debate on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.
Why do people run for Senate?, Shaheen said. I think that that answer isnt always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that thats what I want to do. Im going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. Ill be around.
Shaheen then left the debate.
According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheens votes will not be considered in the final count.
Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.

6,"Students receive email warnings from UC Davis police
The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as suspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident and campus timely warning/hate incident. 
On Jan. 30, the letters KKK were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union womens bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. 
Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. 
Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. 
The people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway, Thomas said. The three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. Were still investigating  what were finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.
The incident Thomas is referring to, the vandalism in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosques door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22. In a university-wide email sent the following day, Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter stated that the crime has caused fear and distress among Davis Muslim community members.
Acts and words of hatred directed toward Muslims as a group is an urgent and growing problem across our society, Hexter said in the email. 
The police department is still unsure if the two on campus incidents are related.
In this political climate, you tend to find a variety of different acts of vandalism, Thomas said. These small acts can become bigger in these sensitive times, and people can react a lot stronger than they would normally.
Andy Fell, associate director of news and media relations at UC Davis, said that the UCDPD has not identified any suspects. 
There are no suspects for either incident, Fell said. They are still being investigated.
Fell said that the theory of an animal dragging and dropping the pork tenderloin is a possibility, but that the investigation is still ensuing. 
That would be a benign explanation, Fell said. Were not able to say anything conclusively at this point. The crime alert we sent out was classified as a hate incident based on the presence of pork outside Muslim students residence.
Dinar Kurji, a second-year religious studies major, believes that the Russell Park incident was targeted towards Muslims to intentionally disparage the community.
I think that act was committed to humiliate a particular sect and to show disrespect, Kurji said.They dont understand that we didnt consume it and that it is not unholy to touch or clean it up. It was done out of ignorance [and] hate and wasnt a positive message."
7,"UC Board of Regents to vote on the appointment later this week
University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced her selection of Gary May as the new UC Davis chancellor on Feb. 21. May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Techs College of Engineering. 
Gary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed, Napolitano said in a press release. He was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe hes the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.
May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on investigative leave last April. Katehi resigned as chancellor in August. 
I could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis, May said in the same press release. UC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.
The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor."
8,"Tighter policies require greater approval of outside jobs
Due to new policies implemented after the investigation of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.
In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.
The new policy requires two levels of review and management approval, a UC report read. In addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.
Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. 
This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehis resignation last year, where she faced a series of controversies including holding seats on two for-profit boards.
Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and womens studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators insurance and hide their mistakes.
Katehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so, Fox said. By them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesnt look bad for the UC as a whole. [] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.
Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.
If Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I dont see whats there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing, Breuninger said. I dont think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there arent conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.
Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.
Everything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC, Fox said. Its embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.
Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.
If the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt, Breuninger said. Their actions are more egregious.
Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.
I dont think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part, Breuninger said. This is something thats in the public eye right now, so I dont have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they wont go straight back to their usual operation."
9,"SR #7 asks university to increase capacity for future campus housing
On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).
Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.
UC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agencys statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project, the notice read. Responses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.
The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.
ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.
Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.
What the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low, Martinez said. So the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times cant find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and its just, its not a good mix when it comes to housing.
UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.
ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.
I definitely think that the issue of housing isnt going away anytime soon, Lee said. The issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, its going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of its population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.
The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasnt always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.
I think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and its not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding, Martinez said. So I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they havent been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.

10,"UC Davis leads in sustainability with largest solar power plant of any university
The University of Californias 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UCs successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.
Were attacking this challenge on multiple fronts  undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change, said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.
The report highlights UC Davis implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.
UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.
Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.
UC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year, Kirk said via email.
Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.
Student activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero, Knox said via email. In 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.
A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. 
Preparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative, Napolitano said in the report.
UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.
Here at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere, Knox said via email. Students can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.
Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.
ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.
UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, which they were supposed to stay under until 2020. 
In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025."
11,"Speakers, including Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, highlight dangers of executive orders for the campus community
In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trumps executive orders on immigration. 
This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to The New York Times.
Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.
Recent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values  values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings, Regulska said. Three recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.
Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.
These three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [] attempt to destroy our community fabric, Regulska said. They also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.
Why are so many who arent directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness? Hexter asked the audience, according to UC Davis Dateline. Part of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are  and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, its difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.
One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trumps executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.
Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students families as well.
Our center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students, Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. Our target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method  they can contact us [] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if youre a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.
While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.
In the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure, Regulska said.
Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally."
12,"Executive order has immediate consequences for UC Davis community
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.
On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled, according to a CNN news report. 60,000 visas were cancelled.
 I am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas, said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his statement to the campus community. This situation touches us closely. 
So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. 
There seems to be some ambiguity as to whether Id be allowed to return, Hamidian said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee.
UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City, said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his message to the community. 
He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.
 Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a masters program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.
On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.
In an interview with ABC News, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.
There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldnt attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home, said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. 
An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now there is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.
The anonymous student also said that there are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.
According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.
Putting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now, White said. Iran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [] dealing with something similar. Weve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships its causing, but its also having broader impacts.
The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations."
13,"Student protesters march from MU flagpole to Mrak Hall
UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale UC-wide day of action, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. 
The students met at the Memorial Union flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. 
Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industrys project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.
This pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River, Ferreyra said. And if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.
The pipelines potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was reported that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. 
It doesnt make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth, said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. 
With President Donald Trumps executive order last month advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administrations stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. 
Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipelines impact on future generations.
This is our world and we borrow the world from the future, Wertheim said.
 The appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability."
14,"Conference entails full day of speakers, panels, student-led discussions
UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. 
After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. 
The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. 
We discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change, Ruttkay said via email.
Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the universitys colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. 
Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. 
It was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences, Olivan said. It definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.
Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as normal, while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. 
Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. 
I had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means, Olivan said. 
Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. 
After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.
We had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful, Ruttkay said. 
Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. 
The students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me, Ruttkay said. I was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health. 
Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. 
Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. 
The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. 
The biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadnt anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times, Chiang said via email.
Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. 
Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. 
A great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy, Olivan said.
Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. 
The biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level, Ruttkay said.
Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. 
Were looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health, Grady said via email. Theres a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.

15,"Shaheens name to remain on ballot, his votes will not be counted
Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD debate on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.
Why do people run for Senate?, Shaheen said. I think that that answer isnt always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that thats what I want to do. Im going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. Ill be around.
Shaheen then left the debate.
According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheens votes will not be considered in the final count.
Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.

16,"Students receive email warnings from UC Davis police
The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as suspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident and campus timely warning/hate incident. 
On Jan. 30, the letters KKK were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union womens bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. 
Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. 
Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. 
The people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway, Thomas said. The three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. Were still investigating  what were finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.
The incident Thomas is referring to, the vandalism in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosques door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22. In a university-wide email sent the following day, Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter stated that the crime has caused fear and distress among Davis Muslim community members.
Acts and words of hatred directed toward Muslims as a group is an urgent and growing problem across our society, Hexter said in the email. 
The police department is still unsure if the two on campus incidents are related.
In this political climate, you tend to find a variety of different acts of vandalism, Thomas said. These small acts can become bigger in these sensitive times, and people can react a lot stronger than they would normally.
Andy Fell, associate director of news and media relations at UC Davis, said that the UCDPD has not identified any suspects. 
There are no suspects for either incident, Fell said. They are still being investigated.
Fell said that the theory of an animal dragging and dropping the pork tenderloin is a possibility, but that the investigation is still ensuing. 
That would be a benign explanation, Fell said. Were not able to say anything conclusively at this point. The crime alert we sent out was classified as a hate incident based on the presence of pork outside Muslim students residence.
Dinar Kurji, a second-year religious studies major, believes that the Russell Park incident was targeted towards Muslims to intentionally disparage the community.
I think that act was committed to humiliate a particular sect and to show disrespect, Kurji said.They dont understand that we didnt consume it and that it is not unholy to touch or clean it up. It was done out of ignorance [and] hate and wasnt a positive message."
17,"UC Board of Regents to vote on the appointment later this week
University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced her selection of Gary May as the new UC Davis chancellor on Feb. 21. May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Techs College of Engineering. 
Gary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed, Napolitano said in a press release. He was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe hes the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.
May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on investigative leave last April. Katehi resigned as chancellor in August. 
I could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis, May said in the same press release. UC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.
The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor."
18,"Tighter policies require greater approval of outside jobs
Due to new policies implemented after the investigation of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.
In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.
The new policy requires two levels of review and management approval, a UC report read. In addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.
Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. 
This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehis resignation last year, where she faced a series of controversies including holding seats on two for-profit boards.
Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and womens studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators insurance and hide their mistakes.
Katehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so, Fox said. By them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesnt look bad for the UC as a whole. [] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.
Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.
If Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I dont see whats there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing, Breuninger said. I dont think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there arent conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.
Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.
Everything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC, Fox said. Its embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.
Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.
If the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt, Breuninger said. Their actions are more egregious.
Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.
I dont think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part, Breuninger said. This is something thats in the public eye right now, so I dont have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they wont go straight back to their usual operation."
19,"SR #7 asks university to increase capacity for future campus housing
On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).
Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.
UC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agencys statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project, the notice read. Responses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.
The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.
ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.
Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.
What the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low, Martinez said. So the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times cant find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and its just, its not a good mix when it comes to housing.
UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.
ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.
I definitely think that the issue of housing isnt going away anytime soon, Lee said. The issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, its going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of its population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.
The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasnt always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.
I think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and its not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding, Martinez said. So I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they havent been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.

20,"UC Davis leads in sustainability with largest solar power plant of any university
The University of Californias 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UCs successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.
Were attacking this challenge on multiple fronts  undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change, said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.
The report highlights UC Davis implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.
UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.
Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.
UC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year, Kirk said via email.
Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.
Student activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero, Knox said via email. In 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.
A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. 
Preparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative, Napolitano said in the report.
UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.
Here at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere, Knox said via email. Students can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.
Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.
ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.
UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, which they were supposed to stay under until 2020. 
In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025."
21,"Speakers, including Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, highlight dangers of executive orders for the campus community
In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trumps executive orders on immigration. 
This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to The New York Times.
Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.
Recent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values  values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings, Regulska said. Three recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.
Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.
These three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [] attempt to destroy our community fabric, Regulska said. They also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.
Why are so many who arent directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness? Hexter asked the audience, according to UC Davis Dateline. Part of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are  and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, its difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.
One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trumps executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.
Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students families as well.
Our center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students, Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. Our target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method  they can contact us [] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if youre a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.
While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.
In the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure, Regulska said.
Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally."
22,"Executive order has immediate consequences for UC Davis community
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.
On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled, according to a CNN news report. 60,000 visas were cancelled.
 I am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas, said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his statement to the campus community. This situation touches us closely. 
So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. 
There seems to be some ambiguity as to whether Id be allowed to return, Hamidian said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee.
UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City, said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his message to the community. 
He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.
 Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a masters program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.
On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.
In an interview with ABC News, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.
There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldnt attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home, said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. 
An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now there is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.
The anonymous student also said that there are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.
According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.
Putting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now, White said. Iran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [] dealing with something similar. Weve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships its causing, but its also having broader impacts.
The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations."
23,"Student protesters march from MU flagpole to Mrak Hall
UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale UC-wide day of action, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. 
The students met at the Memorial Union flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. 
Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industrys project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.
This pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River, Ferreyra said. And if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.
The pipelines potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was reported that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. 
It doesnt make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth, said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. 
With President Donald Trumps executive order last month advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administrations stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. 
Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipelines impact on future generations.
This is our world and we borrow the world from the future, Wertheim said.
 The appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability."
24,"Conference entails full day of speakers, panels, student-led discussions
UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. 
After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. 
The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. 
We discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change, Ruttkay said via email.
Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the universitys colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. 
Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. 
It was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences, Olivan said. It definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.
Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as normal, while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. 
Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. 
I had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means, Olivan said. 
Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. 
After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.
We had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful, Ruttkay said. 
Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. 
The students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me, Ruttkay said. I was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health. 
Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. 
Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. 
The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. 
The biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadnt anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times, Chiang said via email.
Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. 
Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. 
A great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy, Olivan said.
Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. 
The biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level, Ruttkay said.
Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. 
Were looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health, Grady said via email. Theres a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.

25,"Last week in Senate
The ASUCD Senate meeting was called to order by Vice President Abhay Sandhu on Feb. 2 at 6:12 p.m. Eight of the 11 senators were present, with President Alex Lee and Senators Julie Jung and Sofia Molodanof marked absent. 
The meeting began with a presentation by Gallo Wineries. The company announced that it is looking to recruit students and graduates for its management sales positions to help lead the company. Company representatives will attend the Career Fair on March 1 to meet with any interested students.
The meeting then motioned into appointments and confirmations, where Sexual Assault Awareness & Advocacy Committee (SAAC) chair Rachelle Fishbin introduced the new SAAC commissioners. After a series of questions, Senator Irveen Grewal moved to confirm the three SAAC commissioners. The motion was seconded and there were no objections.
After confirmation of members, the Senate discussed consideration of old legislation. Senate Bill #36 addresses the update of Chapter 21 of the ASUCD Bylaws. According to the bill background, many of the ASUCD Bylaws are outdated, inconsistent and disorganized. This bill creates consistency in Chapter 21 with regard to previously passed bills and updates sections that were technologically outdated. Grewal moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate Bill #37 discusses the decision to mandate quarterly commission presentations. Senator Simran Grewal moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate Bill #38 will require newly-elected or appointed ASUCD senators to attend legislation writing presentations by the Internal Affairs and Business and Finance Commission Chairs. Senator Ricardo Martinez moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate also introduced new legislation and spoke about the ASUCD bills that will go to committees soon. This included a bill to establish the Disability Rights Awareness Committee, a resolution to urge the University of California to divest from fossil fuels and a bill to allocate $120 to the Coffee House to be used at an ASUCD lunch. They then motioned into ex officio and elected officer reports. "
26,"Executive: Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin
In order to follow through with their winter 2016 senatorial platforms into a new term, Josh Dalavai, a third-year political science major, and Adilla Jamaludin, a third-year international agricultural development major, have decided to run on the Based slate executive ticket for the 2017 winter elections.

I think the way that this [partnership] came about was that we both realized [] that we had a good enough experience pool and similar goals to [try] this at the next level, Dalavai said. It helps that were really good friends, too. 
If elected as president and vice president, Dalavai and Jamaludin plan to address issues specific to students by maintaining UC Davis status as a sanctuary campus, conducting more efficient student engagement, providing adequate lighting in dim areas of campus and incorporating resources for housing and food security.
Its a comprehensive effort, and ASUCD is in a good position to be in contact with all these different groups, Jamaludin said. We really want to take a strong stance about [the sanctuary campus status]. We are aware we are not the only students who care about this issue. 
Through their partnership, the two plan to work as a team to achieve what the campus wants to see from its student government, since nothing is a one person show.
With every project [] theres always already someone working on it or someone whos had the idea but just didnt know how to do it, so we definitely incorporate student input and the voices of students past and voices of students current in everything that we do, Dalavai said. Whenever you do public service, its collaborative [] inherently so.

Sam Chiang
If elected for her second term, Sam Chiang, a third-year English major, hopes to continue her work on the issues she has shown passion for during her time in Senate thus far.

A lot of my platforms [] have similar themes [as last winter], but obviously theyre different projects, Chiang said. The things I care about havent changed really, if anything I just care more now.
Basing her platforms on mental health awareness, cultural competency, international student accommodations and disability rights advocacy and outreach, one of the things Chiang hopes to establish is a mental health awareness month that represents many communities on campus and their needs.
I think people do care about the work we can do and we can help their communities, so by going to the communities and helping them put on the events that they want to put on in mental health can be very powerful, Chiang said. We need to be more in touch with our communities [and] its things like that that make us better representatives. 

Khadeja Ibrahim
Khadeja Ibrahim, a third-year political science major, has served as a staffer for former ASUCD senator and current vice presidential candidate Adilla Jamaludin. One of her main goals as a senator would be to create a minority leadership program.
Its a program I want to create specifically for minority students on campus that would provide them with resources and assistance so that they could pursue government careers in the future, Ibrahim said. [] The reason I want to create something like this is because I dont think theres anything like it on campus at the moment and Id like to see more minority representation in local and national government, and I think that starts on college campuses.
Ibrahims other main platform focuses around mental health. She hopes to help students increase their amounts of sleep by expanding nap areas available on campus and doubling the number of hammocks on the Quad.

Bespoke
Rosy Martinez
Third-year human development major Rosy Martinezs senate campaign platforms are founded from her experience as the external director at the ASUCD Pantry. She has plans to address food insecurity and student homelessness, promote higher administrative accountability and improve financial aid services.

Currently, the [financial aid offices] hours are [] sort of impossible for the working student to have any access [to], Martinez said. Id like to extend those hours [] and also have a liaison there [] so students have someone they can talk to and [to] be the mediator between the financial aid person and the [student] themselves.
As a co-founder of the slate Bespoke, Martinez would focus her time in Senate on those in need across the UC Davis campus.
[As a slate] were trying to sort of drift away from the high political [] reigns of things and have a community orientation, Martinez said. We wanted to be more than a slate and more of an organization.

Marcos Ismael Rodriguez
Marcos Ismael Rodriguez, a second-year political science public service major, decided to run for Senate in this quarters election after staffing for a number of its members, including Kamal Thomas, Ricardo Martinez and then-senator Alex Lee.

I joined [ASUCD] the first quarter of my first year here, Rodriguez said. I [have also] joined the business and finance commission of ASUCD and [] Ive been the vice-chair for about a year now.
If elected on the Bespoke slate, Rodriguez would like to create more opportunities for different campus communities to include their voice in student government. In addition to the issues of ASUCD transparency and becoming a representative for the ChiLat community in his position in senate, one of Rodriguezs passions is to expand the Housing Advising for Undergraduate Students unit (HAUS).
I plan [to] help [HAUS] create housing advisors, which is what their original purpose was supposed to be, as well as expand Housing Day and make more accessible tools for students to know renters rights, Rodriguez said. In light of the housing crisis, some property managers might want to take abuse to that.

Rahi Suryawanshi
Rahi Suryawanshi, a third-year international relations major with an emphasis in environmental policy, spent the past year as a staff member for current senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal while also holding leadership roles in Startup Hub, #Include and Bakuhatsu Taiko Dan collegiate Japanese drumming.

Through Startup Hub I have seen [] peoples ideas slowly turning into reality, [and with #Include,] Ive seen people [who] have already created their ideas, Suryawanshi said. I see the determination and diligence and also the business mind that you need to achieve initiatives. 
If elected, Suryawanshi will work to provide UC Davis with free self defense workshops, an online forum for research opportunities and allyship workshops in the residence halls  all based on the idea of community and student government communication.
As an international student, [] I have lived and seen the importances of people of different ethnicities living together, Suryawanshi said. That is fairly important to my core, and I think its important [] for all kinds of students to learn what communities they live amongst and how they can support these communities when the time comes.

Yajaira Ramirez Sigala
Yajaira Ramirez Sigala, a second-year sustainable agriculture food systems and Chicana/o studies double major, wants to utilize her experience helping in the AB540 Undocumented Student Center as an ASUCD senator.

I want to make sure that the undocumented community is being included in these dialogues that are happening on campus, and [] that there is somebody facilitating those conversations when talking about the undocumented experience, Ramirez Sigala said. We dont want that narrative to be taken over by another person that might not necessarily be undocumented.
Ramirez Sigalas campaign platforms focus on the inclusive conversations on campus regarding underrepresented groups, including mandatory sensibility trainings across campus, safe-zone commissions and awareness for the undocumented community. 
[This] would mean collaborating with other departments on campus and letting them know about the experiences that other underrepresented communities have faced before coming to Davis so that there can be a more positive student experience on campus, Ramirez Sigala said. [We have to] make it more inclusive with letting them know of the other experiences that students might come [with].

Independent
Executive: Jaskaran Cheema 
Jaskaran Cheema, a fourth-year neurobiology, physiology and behavior major, holds platforms which include increasing the number of squat racks and benches at the Activities and Recreation Center, renovating old bathrooms on campus and securing better WiFi on the Quad.

We wanted to tackle issues pertaining to a vast array of students, Cheema said via email. Therefore, our platform is based on the betterment of campus to foster a healthy learning environment for all students.
Although Cheema will be shown on the ballot as running with third-year economics major Zuhair Bhatti, due to personal reasons, Bhatti is no longer running with Cheema.
We have selected a few experienced candidates which we will decide on if we win the election, Cheema said.
Cheema also hopes to expand career and sexual assault prevention resources for students, ensure that students receive 10 free scantrons per year and increase the amount of hammocks on campus.

Samir Himes
If elected, Samir Himes, a second-year economics major, hopes to increase funding for ASUCDs Entertainment Council so that more performance artists can come to UC Davis.

A lot of other big schools have events [] I think thats something the student body really wants, Himes said. I know tons of people who go out of town each weekend to go to shows and I think thats a loss to the UC Davis community.
Himes also intends to introduce legislation for transparency in the Club Finance Council (CFC) after some students had an issue with getting the CFC to fund security for the Milo Yiannapoulous event.
Students were upset that their money was going to something they didnt want it to and so Im proposing that the CFC, before they give money to an event, [that] they have to make a public notice, which is similar to how a lot of city governments work, Himes said.
Additionally, Himes wants to put plastic nubs on the bottom of the librarys chairs to decrease the loud noise that the chairs make when pushed in and pulled out.

Michael Gofman
First-year economics major Michael Gofman has centered his campaign around three platforms: sustainability, affordability and improvement of student-teacher relations.

I want to get all the [leaders of the] different environmental organizations on campus [] to sit down at the table together and to centralize the environmental movement at UC Davis, because were already one of the most sustainable universities in the world without being centralized, but if we centralize we can achieve much bigger projects and the leaders will see how vast their resources are in order to achieve different tasks, Gofman said.
As part of his affordability platform, Gofman, who has helped write grants for the ASUCD Pantry, hopes to expand the programs resources.
Im hoping to as a senator [] help them find more consistent and reliable outside donors and funds from various funding organizations and grants to make sure that whatever the ASUCD budget situation is, however much money they have, no student on campus is going hungry, Gofman said. 

Zaki Shaheen
As a transfer student, Zaki Shaheen, a third-year political science major, is looking for ways to ease the transition for transfer students coming to UC Davis.

Im a transfer student, so a big platform of mine is working with the Transfer Re-entry Veteran Services Center to provide an increased amount of services to transfer students as well as [to] basically just give a better kind of information about what is available to them to better integrate them into the Davis community because it can be more difficult coming in later, Shaheen said.
Shaheens also plans on working with the Office of Advocacy and Student Representation to maintain and improve sexual assault prevention resources. If elected, he hopes to be a representative for different minority groups on campus. 
Im including my phone number on my [campaign] flyers and everywhere because I guess a theme of what Im trying to run under is that I want to be accessible to everyone, Shaheen said.

Frank McGreal
Frank McGreal, a second-year managerial economics major, drew largely on his experience as an orientation leader while creating his platforms.

I want to implement a seminar at the beginning of each quarter [] for any incoming students or anyone who wants to see them [to show] different resources that we offer on campus, different clubs and different communities that are available in order to make the transition from whatever previous institution that they were at to coming to UC Davis as seamless as possible, McGreal said. 
McGreal also hopes to create a mentorship program that would collaborate with the City of Davis to match an undergraduate student with an underprivileged youth.
[This] mentorship program [would] hopefully influence youth in our city to want to go to a higher [educational] institution one day, McGreal said. "
27,"New showcase provides opportunity for students to learn about citys history
A new exhibit recently opened at Peter J. Shields Library to celebrate the upcoming centennial of the City of Davis. The showcase, titled Davis 1917-2017: Celebrating 100 Years of Community, features material from more than 15 separate collections and will be on display until June 18.
Sara Gunasekara, a public services and archives specialist at the Shields Library, said that the project provides a lot of historical background pertaining to the founding of Davis, which was incorporated as a city on March 28, 1917. The previous year, a large fire had struck the downtown business district, creating a need for redevelopment.
So one of the key things was that there was a fire in downtown Davis in November of 1916, Gunasekara said. It hadnt yet been incorporated, there was talk of incorporation in 1911 and then in the spring of 1916 they had started talking about incorporating again but hadnt really gotten their feet under them.
The exhibit, which is free and open to the public during normal library hours, includes unique photographs and personal papers which document the citys 100-year history.
Jessica Nusbaum, the associate director of communications and marketing for the library, said that much of the material provided from the librarys Special Collections has been well received.
One of the things thats cool about Special Collections here at the UC Davis library is that we have some stuff that no one else has, Nusbaum said. So even the city was like, oh you guys have good pictures from the fire? Can we have those cause we wanna help tell that story that was so integral to the founding of the city, too. So theres some really unique pieces here at Special Collections that go beyond even what the city itself has and were really proud to help tell the local history story that way.
The librarys online page includes further material on the exhibit as well as links and information for the multiple collections from which the materials were gathered.
Stacy Winton, a media and communications officer for the City of Davis, said that Davis has been thankful for the exhibit.
With our utmost gratitude, we thank UC Davis Special Collections staff for creating an impressive exhibit of the Citys history over the past 100 years, Winton said via email.
For Gunasekara, working on the exhibit presented a fulfilling experience to examine the history of both UC Davis and the City of Davis.
I think for me, it was just a really enjoyable exhibit to work on, Gunasekara said. Theyre all fun but for me, it was such a large story to tell about the history. Of course I couldnt tell the entire minutiae of the history, but I greatly enjoyed working on it and learning more about the town I come to work in everyday.
Nusbaum said that the exhibit will be open long enough for students and their families to visit through Spring 2017. As students continue to visit, Gunasekara hopes that they can understand the value in what the library has been able to gather through its many exhibits.
Having exhibits like this out that I think people can really connect with is also a way to educate students about all of the amazing resources that Special Collections has here at the library, Nusbaum said. And without the exhibits, people might not have a way to find out that there are all these historic materials here at the library. You know, people may not know that the library is a repository for that kind of storytelling of the history of the campus and the history of the local community if we didnt do things like this.
"
28,"Students promote fruit and vegetable meals via social media 
The Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) hosted the Step Up to the Plate campaign on campus from Jan. 23-27 in order to encourage students to fill half of their plates with fruits and vegetables. The campaign, which was run by the Health Education and Promotion department within the SHCS, included outreach events such as tabling at the Student Community Center and the Activities and Recreation Center to give out free bananas and oranges to students. 
Based on the latest American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment, a research survey about college student wellness, less than 6 percent of undergrads and 10 percent of graduate students consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. The campaigns goal was to increase that percentage and to educate students about the health benefits of consuming more fruits and vegetables daily. 
The campaign slogan was Step Up to the Plate. Make 1/2 Your Plate Fruits and Veggies. The hashtag #aggieplate was used throughout the campaign to prompt students to post photos of their plates filled halfway with fruits and vegetables. A winner was drawn and awarded a $10 ASUCD CoHo gift card. Daisy Valdez, a health education and promotion wellness student assistant who worked on the campaign, believes that students learned an important message from the campaign. 
I believe students gained a reminder of the importance of eating more fruits and vegetables as well as learned about easy ways to increase their consumption of fruits and veggies Valdez said. Making half your plate fruits and veggies is such a simple way to increase the amount you are eating, so we received positive feedback from students about using it as a tool. One of the highlights of this campaign was the fresh fruit giveaways. Students were pleasantly surprised to receive free fruit.
Stephanie Goley, a fourth-year science and technology major, likes eating fruit and is happy it is offered on campus. 
I particularly like berries, Goley said. Specifically blueberries and raspberries because they are rich in antioxidants. 
Yosenia Ruiz, a first-year biology major, likes how many healthy promotions and options UC Davis offers and is happy knowing there was a campaign encouraging students to eat healthier. 
It can be really easy to just choose the cheap, fast and fattening food option, especially in college when you are on a tight budget, Ruiz said. I have the dining commons where I still get a lot of food options but once I move out I need to find resources like this one that can provide for me healthy options. "
29,"New fees to pay for equipment replacement
To compensate for a decrease in university-allotted funds, the Department of Physical Education has proposed adding a fee to physical education (PE) classes starting in the fall of 2017. The funds would be allocated to equipment replacement and additional costs associated with specific classes.
Previously, students could enroll in PE classes for a half-unit without paying any fees beyond baseline tuition costs. But starting next Fall Quarter, classes such as badminton or tennis that use additional equipment will cost between $1 and $2.50. Classes that dont require any equipment, like fitness walking or swimming, will remain free of additional costs. The biggest increase will apply to archery, rock climbing, self defense and golf classes due to the additional resources and equipment needed. 
According to Barbara Jahn, the supervisor of the Department of Physical Education, the department is aiming to keep costs as low as possible while also working to improve the quality of PE classes.
In order to maintain these classes, which are extremely popular, we are proposing that we [apply a] charge, Jahn said. Thats so we can continue teaching classes and replacing equipment [] I dont really like charging the students who are already paying for their classes, but we have to figure out a way to economically to continue. We are not getting the financial support in that area from the administration.
Some students feel as though the additional fee is unwarranted, as they already pay tuition to take classes. Stephen Curry, a second-year chemical engineer major, is currently enrolled in a rock climbing class. Curry explained that the price hike would have deterred him from taking the class.
Its ridiculous, Curry said. I definitely wouldnt have taken the class if it cost money, but they are lots of fun and they are a great way to maintain a balanced life. Some students dont have the time to go to the gym and with PE classes it forced me to stay fit and it made time in my schedule to go to the gym.
Jahn predicted that class enrollment would see little change. She said that the golf program, for example, already charges a fee to cover use at the Davis Municipal Golf Course but still consistently has full enrollment.
It might [impact enrollment], but I dont think so, Jahn said. Right now those golf courses are full and they are paying $23. For the self defense class, I dont think that people would consider not taking that.
Matthew Stuke, a second-year neurobiology, physiology and biology major, had considered taking a PE class but explained that an increased price on top of tuition for a low unit class would possibly make him reconsider."
30,"Shaheens name to remain on ballot, his votes will not be counted
Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD debate on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.
Why do people run for Senate?, Shaheen said. I think that that answer isnt always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that thats what I want to do. Im going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. Ill be around.
Shaheen then left the debate.
According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheens votes will not be considered in the final count.
Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.

31,"Students receive email warnings from UC Davis police
The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as suspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident and campus timely warning/hate incident. 
On Jan. 30, the letters KKK were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union womens bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. 
Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. 
Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. 
The people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway, Thomas said. The three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. Were still investigating  what were finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.
The incident Thomas is referring to, the vandalism in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosques door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22. In a university-wide email sent the following day, Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter stated that the crime has caused fear and distress among Davis Muslim community members.
Acts and words of hatred directed toward Muslims as a group is an urgent and growing problem across our society, Hexter said in the email. 
The police department is still unsure if the two on campus incidents are related.
In this political climate, you tend to find a variety of different acts of vandalism, Thomas said. These small acts can become bigger in these sensitive times, and people can react a lot stronger than they would normally.
Andy Fell, associate director of news and media relations at UC Davis, said that the UCDPD has not identified any suspects. 
There are no suspects for either incident, Fell said. They are still being investigated.
Fell said that the theory of an animal dragging and dropping the pork tenderloin is a possibility, but that the investigation is still ensuing. 
That would be a benign explanation, Fell said. Were not able to say anything conclusively at this point. The crime alert we sent out was classified as a hate incident based on the presence of pork outside Muslim students residence.
Dinar Kurji, a second-year religious studies major, believes that the Russell Park incident was targeted towards Muslims to intentionally disparage the community.
I think that act was committed to humiliate a particular sect and to show disrespect, Kurji said.They dont understand that we didnt consume it and that it is not unholy to touch or clean it up. It was done out of ignorance [and] hate and wasnt a positive message."
32,"UC Board of Regents to vote on the appointment later this week
University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced her selection of Gary May as the new UC Davis chancellor on Feb. 21. May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Techs College of Engineering. 
Gary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed, Napolitano said in a press release. He was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe hes the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.
May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on investigative leave last April. Katehi resigned as chancellor in August. 
I could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis, May said in the same press release. UC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.
The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor."
33,"Tighter policies require greater approval of outside jobs
Due to new policies implemented after the investigation of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.
In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.
The new policy requires two levels of review and management approval, a UC report read. In addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.
Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. 
This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehis resignation last year, where she faced a series of controversies including holding seats on two for-profit boards.
Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and womens studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators insurance and hide their mistakes.
Katehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so, Fox said. By them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesnt look bad for the UC as a whole. [] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.
Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.
If Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I dont see whats there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing, Breuninger said. I dont think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there arent conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.
Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.
Everything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC, Fox said. Its embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.
Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.
If the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt, Breuninger said. Their actions are more egregious.
Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.
I dont think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part, Breuninger said. This is something thats in the public eye right now, so I dont have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they wont go straight back to their usual operation."
34,"SR #7 asks university to increase capacity for future campus housing
On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).
Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.
UC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agencys statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project, the notice read. Responses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.
The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.
ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.
Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.
What the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low, Martinez said. So the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times cant find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and its just, its not a good mix when it comes to housing.
UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.
ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.
I definitely think that the issue of housing isnt going away anytime soon, Lee said. The issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, its going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of its population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.
The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasnt always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.
I think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and its not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding, Martinez said. So I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they havent been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.

35,"UC Davis leads in sustainability with largest solar power plant of any university
The University of Californias 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UCs successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.
Were attacking this challenge on multiple fronts  undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change, said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.
The report highlights UC Davis implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.
UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.
Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.
UC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year, Kirk said via email.
Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.
Student activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero, Knox said via email. In 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.
A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. 
Preparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative, Napolitano said in the report.
UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.
Here at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere, Knox said via email. Students can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.
Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.
ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.
UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, which they were supposed to stay under until 2020. 
In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025."
36,"Speakers, including Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, highlight dangers of executive orders for the campus community
In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trumps executive orders on immigration. 
This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to The New York Times.
Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.
Recent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values  values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings, Regulska said. Three recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.
Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.
These three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [] attempt to destroy our community fabric, Regulska said. They also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.
Why are so many who arent directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness? Hexter asked the audience, according to UC Davis Dateline. Part of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are  and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, its difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.
One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trumps executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.
Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students families as well.
Our center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students, Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. Our target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method  they can contact us [] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if youre a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.
While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.
In the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure, Regulska said.
Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally."
37,"Executive order has immediate consequences for UC Davis community
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.
On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled, according to a CNN news report. 60,000 visas were cancelled.
 I am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas, said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his statement to the campus community. This situation touches us closely. 
So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. 
There seems to be some ambiguity as to whether Id be allowed to return, Hamidian said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee.
UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City, said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his message to the community. 
He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.
 Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a masters program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.
On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.
In an interview with ABC News, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.
There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldnt attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home, said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. 
An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now there is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.
The anonymous student also said that there are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.
According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.
Putting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now, White said. Iran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [] dealing with something similar. Weve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships its causing, but its also having broader impacts.
The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations."
38,"Student protesters march from MU flagpole to Mrak Hall
UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale UC-wide day of action, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. 
The students met at the Memorial Union flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. 
Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industrys project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.
This pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River, Ferreyra said. And if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.
The pipelines potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was reported that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. 
It doesnt make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth, said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. 
With President Donald Trumps executive order last month advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administrations stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. 
Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipelines impact on future generations.
This is our world and we borrow the world from the future, Wertheim said.
 The appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability."
39,"Conference entails full day of speakers, panels, student-led discussions
UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. 
After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. 
The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. 
We discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change, Ruttkay said via email.
Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the universitys colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. 
Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. 
It was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences, Olivan said. It definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.
Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as normal, while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. 
Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. 
I had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means, Olivan said. 
Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. 
After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.
We had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful, Ruttkay said. 
Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. 
The students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me, Ruttkay said. I was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health. 
Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. 
Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. 
The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. 
The biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadnt anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times, Chiang said via email.
Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. 
Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. 
A great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy, Olivan said.
Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. 
The biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level, Ruttkay said.
Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. 
Were looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health, Grady said via email. Theres a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.

40,"Last week in Senate
The ASUCD Senate meeting was called to order by Vice President Abhay Sandhu on Feb. 2 at 6:12 p.m. Eight of the 11 senators were present, with President Alex Lee and Senators Julie Jung and Sofia Molodanof marked absent. 
The meeting began with a presentation by Gallo Wineries. The company announced that it is looking to recruit students and graduates for its management sales positions to help lead the company. Company representatives will attend the Career Fair on March 1 to meet with any interested students.
The meeting then motioned into appointments and confirmations, where Sexual Assault Awareness & Advocacy Committee (SAAC) chair Rachelle Fishbin introduced the new SAAC commissioners. After a series of questions, Senator Irveen Grewal moved to confirm the three SAAC commissioners. The motion was seconded and there were no objections.
After confirmation of members, the Senate discussed consideration of old legislation. Senate Bill #36 addresses the update of Chapter 21 of the ASUCD Bylaws. According to the bill background, many of the ASUCD Bylaws are outdated, inconsistent and disorganized. This bill creates consistency in Chapter 21 with regard to previously passed bills and updates sections that were technologically outdated. Grewal moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate Bill #37 discusses the decision to mandate quarterly commission presentations. Senator Simran Grewal moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate Bill #38 will require newly-elected or appointed ASUCD senators to attend legislation writing presentations by the Internal Affairs and Business and Finance Commission Chairs. Senator Ricardo Martinez moved to call the bill into question. The motion was seconded and there were no objections. 
Senate also introduced new legislation and spoke about the ASUCD bills that will go to committees soon. This included a bill to establish the Disability Rights Awareness Committee, a resolution to urge the University of California to divest from fossil fuels and a bill to allocate $120 to the Coffee House to be used at an ASUCD lunch. They then motioned into ex officio and elected officer reports. "
41,"Executive: Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin
In order to follow through with their winter 2016 senatorial platforms into a new term, Josh Dalavai, a third-year political science major, and Adilla Jamaludin, a third-year international agricultural development major, have decided to run on the Based slate executive ticket for the 2017 winter elections.

I think the way that this [partnership] came about was that we both realized [] that we had a good enough experience pool and similar goals to [try] this at the next level, Dalavai said. It helps that were really good friends, too. 
If elected as president and vice president, Dalavai and Jamaludin plan to address issues specific to students by maintaining UC Davis status as a sanctuary campus, conducting more efficient student engagement, providing adequate lighting in dim areas of campus and incorporating resources for housing and food security.
Its a comprehensive effort, and ASUCD is in a good position to be in contact with all these different groups, Jamaludin said. We really want to take a strong stance about [the sanctuary campus status]. We are aware we are not the only students who care about this issue. 
Through their partnership, the two plan to work as a team to achieve what the campus wants to see from its student government, since nothing is a one person show.
With every project [] theres always already someone working on it or someone whos had the idea but just didnt know how to do it, so we definitely incorporate student input and the voices of students past and voices of students current in everything that we do, Dalavai said. Whenever you do public service, its collaborative [] inherently so.

Sam Chiang
If elected for her second term, Sam Chiang, a third-year English major, hopes to continue her work on the issues she has shown passion for during her time in Senate thus far.

A lot of my platforms [] have similar themes [as last winter], but obviously theyre different projects, Chiang said. The things I care about havent changed really, if anything I just care more now.
Basing her platforms on mental health awareness, cultural competency, international student accommodations and disability rights advocacy and outreach, one of the things Chiang hopes to establish is a mental health awareness month that represents many communities on campus and their needs.
I think people do care about the work we can do and we can help their communities, so by going to the communities and helping them put on the events that they want to put on in mental health can be very powerful, Chiang said. We need to be more in touch with our communities [and] its things like that that make us better representatives. 

Khadeja Ibrahim
Khadeja Ibrahim, a third-year political science major, has served as a staffer for former ASUCD senator and current vice presidential candidate Adilla Jamaludin. One of her main goals as a senator would be to create a minority leadership program.
Its a program I want to create specifically for minority students on campus that would provide them with resources and assistance so that they could pursue government careers in the future, Ibrahim said. [] The reason I want to create something like this is because I dont think theres anything like it on campus at the moment and Id like to see more minority representation in local and national government, and I think that starts on college campuses.
Ibrahims other main platform focuses around mental health. She hopes to help students increase their amounts of sleep by expanding nap areas available on campus and doubling the number of hammocks on the Quad.

Bespoke
Rosy Martinez
Third-year human development major Rosy Martinezs senate campaign platforms are founded from her experience as the external director at the ASUCD Pantry. She has plans to address food insecurity and student homelessness, promote higher administrative accountability and improve financial aid services.

Currently, the [financial aid offices] hours are [] sort of impossible for the working student to have any access [to], Martinez said. Id like to extend those hours [] and also have a liaison there [] so students have someone they can talk to and [to] be the mediator between the financial aid person and the [student] themselves.
As a co-founder of the slate Bespoke, Martinez would focus her time in Senate on those in need across the UC Davis campus.
[As a slate] were trying to sort of drift away from the high political [] reigns of things and have a community orientation, Martinez said. We wanted to be more than a slate and more of an organization.

Marcos Ismael Rodriguez
Marcos Ismael Rodriguez, a second-year political science public service major, decided to run for Senate in this quarters election after staffing for a number of its members, including Kamal Thomas, Ricardo Martinez and then-senator Alex Lee.

I joined [ASUCD] the first quarter of my first year here, Rodriguez said. I [have also] joined the business and finance commission of ASUCD and [] Ive been the vice-chair for about a year now.
If elected on the Bespoke slate, Rodriguez would like to create more opportunities for different campus communities to include their voice in student government. In addition to the issues of ASUCD transparency and becoming a representative for the ChiLat community in his position in senate, one of Rodriguezs passions is to expand the Housing Advising for Undergraduate Students unit (HAUS).
I plan [to] help [HAUS] create housing advisors, which is what their original purpose was supposed to be, as well as expand Housing Day and make more accessible tools for students to know renters rights, Rodriguez said. In light of the housing crisis, some property managers might want to take abuse to that.

Rahi Suryawanshi
Rahi Suryawanshi, a third-year international relations major with an emphasis in environmental policy, spent the past year as a staff member for current senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal while also holding leadership roles in Startup Hub, #Include and Bakuhatsu Taiko Dan collegiate Japanese drumming.

Through Startup Hub I have seen [] peoples ideas slowly turning into reality, [and with #Include,] Ive seen people [who] have already created their ideas, Suryawanshi said. I see the determination and diligence and also the business mind that you need to achieve initiatives. 
If elected, Suryawanshi will work to provide UC Davis with free self defense workshops, an online forum for research opportunities and allyship workshops in the residence halls  all based on the idea of community and student government communication.
As an international student, [] I have lived and seen the importances of people of different ethnicities living together, Suryawanshi said. That is fairly important to my core, and I think its important [] for all kinds of students to learn what communities they live amongst and how they can support these communities when the time comes.

Yajaira Ramirez Sigala
Yajaira Ramirez Sigala, a second-year sustainable agriculture food systems and Chicana/o studies double major, wants to utilize her experience helping in the AB540 Undocumented Student Center as an ASUCD senator.

I want to make sure that the undocumented community is being included in these dialogues that are happening on campus, and [] that there is somebody facilitating those conversations when talking about the undocumented experience, Ramirez Sigala said. We dont want that narrative to be taken over by another person that might not necessarily be undocumented.
Ramirez Sigalas campaign platforms focus on the inclusive conversations on campus regarding underrepresented groups, including mandatory sensibility trainings across campus, safe-zone commissions and awareness for the undocumented community. 
[This] would mean collaborating with other departments on campus and letting them know about the experiences that other underrepresented communities have faced before coming to Davis so that there can be a more positive student experience on campus, Ramirez Sigala said. [We have to] make it more inclusive with letting them know of the other experiences that students might come [with].

Independent
Executive: Jaskaran Cheema 
Jaskaran Cheema, a fourth-year neurobiology, physiology and behavior major, holds platforms which include increasing the number of squat racks and benches at the Activities and Recreation Center, renovating old bathrooms on campus and securing better WiFi on the Quad.

We wanted to tackle issues pertaining to a vast array of students, Cheema said via email. Therefore, our platform is based on the betterment of campus to foster a healthy learning environment for all students.
Although Cheema will be shown on the ballot as running with third-year economics major Zuhair Bhatti, due to personal reasons, Bhatti is no longer running with Cheema.
We have selected a few experienced candidates which we will decide on if we win the election, Cheema said.
Cheema also hopes to expand career and sexual assault prevention resources for students, ensure that students receive 10 free scantrons per year and increase the amount of hammocks on campus.

Samir Himes
If elected, Samir Himes, a second-year economics major, hopes to increase funding for ASUCDs Entertainment Council so that more performance artists can come to UC Davis.

A lot of other big schools have events [] I think thats something the student body really wants, Himes said. I know tons of people who go out of town each weekend to go to shows and I think thats a loss to the UC Davis community.
Himes also intends to introduce legislation for transparency in the Club Finance Council (CFC) after some students had an issue with getting the CFC to fund security for the Milo Yiannapoulous event.
Students were upset that their money was going to something they didnt want it to and so Im proposing that the CFC, before they give money to an event, [that] they have to make a public notice, which is similar to how a lot of city governments work, Himes said.
Additionally, Himes wants to put plastic nubs on the bottom of the librarys chairs to decrease the loud noise that the chairs make when pushed in and pulled out.

Michael Gofman
First-year economics major Michael Gofman has centered his campaign around three platforms: sustainability, affordability and improvement of student-teacher relations.

I want to get all the [leaders of the] different environmental organizations on campus [] to sit down at the table together and to centralize the environmental movement at UC Davis, because were already one of the most sustainable universities in the world without being centralized, but if we centralize we can achieve much bigger projects and the leaders will see how vast their resources are in order to achieve different tasks, Gofman said.
As part of his affordability platform, Gofman, who has helped write grants for the ASUCD Pantry, hopes to expand the programs resources.
Im hoping to as a senator [] help them find more consistent and reliable outside donors and funds from various funding organizations and grants to make sure that whatever the ASUCD budget situation is, however much money they have, no student on campus is going hungry, Gofman said. 

Zaki Shaheen
As a transfer student, Zaki Shaheen, a third-year political science major, is looking for ways to ease the transition for transfer students coming to UC Davis.

Im a transfer student, so a big platform of mine is working with the Transfer Re-entry Veteran Services Center to provide an increased amount of services to transfer students as well as [to] basically just give a better kind of information about what is available to them to better integrate them into the Davis community because it can be more difficult coming in later, Shaheen said.
Shaheens also plans on working with the Office of Advocacy and Student Representation to maintain and improve sexual assault prevention resources. If elected, he hopes to be a representative for different minority groups on campus. 
Im including my phone number on my [campaign] flyers and everywhere because I guess a theme of what Im trying to run under is that I want to be accessible to everyone, Shaheen said.

Frank McGreal
Frank McGreal, a second-year managerial economics major, drew largely on his experience as an orientation leader while creating his platforms.

I want to implement a seminar at the beginning of each quarter [] for any incoming students or anyone who wants to see them [to show] different resources that we offer on campus, different clubs and different communities that are available in order to make the transition from whatever previous institution that they were at to coming to UC Davis as seamless as possible, McGreal said. 
McGreal also hopes to create a mentorship program that would collaborate with the City of Davis to match an undergraduate student with an underprivileged youth.
[This] mentorship program [would] hopefully influence youth in our city to want to go to a higher [educational] institution one day, McGreal said. "
42,"New showcase provides opportunity for students to learn about citys history
A new exhibit recently opened at Peter J. Shields Library to celebrate the upcoming centennial of the City of Davis. The showcase, titled Davis 1917-2017: Celebrating 100 Years of Community, features material from more than 15 separate collections and will be on display until June 18.
Sara Gunasekara, a public services and archives specialist at the Shields Library, said that the project provides a lot of historical background pertaining to the founding of Davis, which was incorporated as a city on March 28, 1917. The previous year, a large fire had struck the downtown business district, creating a need for redevelopment.
So one of the key things was that there was a fire in downtown Davis in November of 1916, Gunasekara said. It hadnt yet been incorporated, there was talk of incorporation in 1911 and then in the spring of 1916 they had started talking about incorporating again but hadnt really gotten their feet under them.
The exhibit, which is free and open to the public during normal library hours, includes unique photographs and personal papers which document the citys 100-year history.
Jessica Nusbaum, the associate director of communications and marketing for the library, said that much of the material provided from the librarys Special Collections has been well received.
One of the things thats cool about Special Collections here at the UC Davis library is that we have some stuff that no one else has, Nusbaum said. So even the city was like, oh you guys have good pictures from the fire? Can we have those cause we wanna help tell that story that was so integral to the founding of the city, too. So theres some really unique pieces here at Special Collections that go beyond even what the city itself has and were really proud to help tell the local history story that way.
The librarys online page includes further material on the exhibit as well as links and information for the multiple collections from which the materials were gathered.
Stacy Winton, a media and communications officer for the City of Davis, said that Davis has been thankful for the exhibit.
With our utmost gratitude, we thank UC Davis Special Collections staff for creating an impressive exhibit of the Citys history over the past 100 years, Winton said via email.
For Gunasekara, working on the exhibit presented a fulfilling experience to examine the history of both UC Davis and the City of Davis.
I think for me, it was just a really enjoyable exhibit to work on, Gunasekara said. Theyre all fun but for me, it was such a large story to tell about the history. Of course I couldnt tell the entire minutiae of the history, but I greatly enjoyed working on it and learning more about the town I come to work in everyday.
Nusbaum said that the exhibit will be open long enough for students and their families to visit through Spring 2017. As students continue to visit, Gunasekara hopes that they can understand the value in what the library has been able to gather through its many exhibits.
Having exhibits like this out that I think people can really connect with is also a way to educate students about all of the amazing resources that Special Collections has here at the library, Nusbaum said. And without the exhibits, people might not have a way to find out that there are all these historic materials here at the library. You know, people may not know that the library is a repository for that kind of storytelling of the history of the campus and the history of the local community if we didnt do things like this.

43,"Students promote fruit and vegetable meals via social media 
The Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) hosted the Step Up to the Plate campaign on campus from Jan. 23-27 in order to encourage students to fill half of their plates with fruits and vegetables. The campaign, which was run by the Health Education and Promotion department within the SHCS, included outreach events such as tabling at the Student Community Center and the Activities and Recreation Center to give out free bananas and oranges to students. 
Based on the latest American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment, a research survey about college student wellness, less than 6 percent of undergrads and 10 percent of graduate students consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. The campaigns goal was to increase that percentage and to educate students about the health benefits of consuming more fruits and vegetables daily. 
The campaign slogan was Step Up to the Plate. Make 1/2 Your Plate Fruits and Veggies. The hashtag #aggieplate was used throughout the campaign to prompt students to post photos of their plates filled halfway with fruits and vegetables. A winner was drawn and awarded a $10 ASUCD CoHo gift card. Daisy Valdez, a health education and promotion wellness student assistant who worked on the campaign, believes that students learned an important message from the campaign. 
I believe students gained a reminder of the importance of eating more fruits and vegetables as well as learned about easy ways to increase their consumption of fruits and veggies Valdez said. Making half your plate fruits and veggies is such a simple way to increase the amount you are eating, so we received positive feedback from students about using it as a tool. One of the highlights of this campaign was the fresh fruit giveaways. Students were pleasantly surprised to receive free fruit.
Stephanie Goley, a fourth-year science and technology major, likes eating fruit and is happy it is offered on campus. 
I particularly like berries, Goley said. Specifically blueberries and raspberries because they are rich in antioxidants. 
Yosenia Ruiz, a first-year biology major, likes how many healthy promotions and options UC Davis offers and is happy knowing there was a campaign encouraging students to eat healthier. 
It can be really easy to just choose the cheap, fast and fattening food option, especially in college when you are on a tight budget, Ruiz said. I have the dining commons where I still get a lot of food options but once I move out I need to find resources like this one that can provide for me healthy options. "
44,"New fees to pay for equipment replacement
To compensate for a decrease in university-allotted funds, the Department of Physical Education has proposed adding a fee to physical education (PE) classes starting in the fall of 2017. The funds would be allocated to equipment replacement and additional costs associated with specific classes.
Previously, students could enroll in PE classes for a half-unit without paying any fees beyond baseline tuition costs. But starting next Fall Quarter, classes such as badminton or tennis that use additional equipment will cost between $1 and $2.50. Classes that dont require any equipment, like fitness walking or swimming, will remain free of additional costs. The biggest increase will apply to archery, rock climbing, self defense and golf classes due to the additional resources and equipment needed. 
According to Barbara Jahn, the supervisor of the Department of Physical Education, the department is aiming to keep costs as low as possible while also working to improve the quality of PE classes.
In order to maintain these classes, which are extremely popular, we are proposing that we [apply a] charge, Jahn said. Thats so we can continue teaching classes and replacing equipment [] I dont really like charging the students who are already paying for their classes, but we have to figure out a way to economically to continue. We are not getting the financial support in that area from the administration.
Some students feel as though the additional fee is unwarranted, as they already pay tuition to take classes. Stephen Curry, a second-year chemical engineer major, is currently enrolled in a rock climbing class. Curry explained that the price hike would have deterred him from taking the class.
Its ridiculous, Curry said. I definitely wouldnt have taken the class if it cost money, but they are lots of fun and they are a great way to maintain a balanced life. Some students dont have the time to go to the gym and with PE classes it forced me to stay fit and it made time in my schedule to go to the gym.
Jahn predicted that class enrollment would see little change. She said that the golf program, for example, already charges a fee to cover use at the Davis Municipal Golf Course but still consistently has full enrollment.
It might [impact enrollment], but I dont think so, Jahn said. Right now those golf courses are full and they are paying $23. For the self defense class, I dont think that people would consider not taking that.
Matthew Stuke, a second-year neurobiology, physiology and biology major, had considered taking a PE class but explained that an increased price on top of tuition for a low unit class would possibly make him reconsider."
45,"Six senators, new executive team elected

Chiang and Ibrahim ran on the BASED slate, while Suryawanshi, Rodriguez and Ramirez Sigala ran on the Bespoke slate. Gofman ran independently.
The new ASUCD president and vice president will be Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin. Dalavai and Jamaludin ran on the BASED slate. 
The results will also be posted online at elections.ucdavis.edu."
46,"Wells Fargo faces fraud, predatory lending charges, other controversies
The University of California (UC) will retract a $300 million line of credit and a $150 million interest reset contract with Wells Fargo by April of this year. $200 million has already been retracted, and the remaining $100 million will be divested after a replacement bank is found. This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. 
In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. Federal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created two million fraudulent bank and credit accounts under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.
 Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. 
Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.
Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos  it settled with the Justice Department for $184.3 million in 2012. 
Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the environmental sustainability officer of the UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.
We came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline, Ferreyra said. These oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they dont care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. Divestment is a historically successful tactic.
On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also ended its contract with Wells Fargo. It will be moving $124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from Wells Fargo on the same day.
Over the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community, Mayor Robb Davis said.
Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking  they are another factor in the councils decision to divest.
Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the universitys rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.
UC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo, Doan wrote via email. However, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.
Connor Gorman, a UC student workers union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was the schools driving force in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. 
The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.
 By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system, a post on the ABC website read. We dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in Americas gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.
Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.
Since the 1970s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of Californias mission to be a world-class public research university system, Pulido said. And we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our countrys ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our companys ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials. 
Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.
Wells Fargo is a bank, Pulido said. We do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we dont tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we dont tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. We have no seat on either companys board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models."
47,"Faculty, students recount personal tales of immigration; highlight value of diversity
UC Davis students, faculty and members of the Davis community gathered on the Quad on Feb. 9 to display their solidarity with those directly affected by President Donald Trumps immigration ban.
In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of Academics United  No Visa and Immigration Ban. Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White  both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association  were the organizers of this peaceful rally.
The event was approximately an hour long, d
uring which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as Love not hate makes the nation great and No ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear. It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including Fox 40 and CBS Sacramento.
Akrami said that her goal for the event was to start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.
The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled My Home Towns Are Home to the World.
In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of proclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city and welcoming people from all over the world.
They have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom, Davis said. This affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.
Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.
Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for following a path that leads to a better world.
Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain love and compassion in such politically turbulent and tense times.
Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellors Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.
Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.
White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.
In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the fading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers and how they may not have the chance to be safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities. 
On a lighter note, he concluded with having immense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.
UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.
As an Iranian, its heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on, Mostafavi said."
48,"Opening date pushed back to May 1
Students have awaited the full reopening of the Memorial Union (MU) for almost two years since its closure in early 2015. Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.
We had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd, said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. However, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.
Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a ceremonial grand opening. Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.
A ceremonial grand opening will take place, Fucile said. Planning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).
Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.
I will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU, Secor said via email. These new spaces are reminiscent of the buildings original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.
Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.
I have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which Ive never experienced, Santamaria said. I have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [] the seating area, that sounds really nice. Youre always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think its just something thats really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.
Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. "
49,"Veto included revision abandoning creation of oversight committee for judicial council
Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).

 Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.

 ASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court, Flores wrote in the amendment. Given the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Councils ruling.

 The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. 

 Lees revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.

 I am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant, Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. If it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.

 In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.
 Allowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review, Lee said. What is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.
 Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.

 Basically, I didnt agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee, Molodanof said via email. I wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didnt like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial boards job is to act as a check). It didnt really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).
 Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCDs judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.

50,"Shaheens name to remain on ballot, his votes will not be counted
Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD debate on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.
Why do people run for Senate?, Shaheen said. I think that that answer isnt always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that thats what I want to do. Im going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. Ill be around.
Shaheen then left the debate.
According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheens votes will not be considered in the final count.
Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.

51,"Students receive email warnings from UC Davis police
The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as suspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident and campus timely warning/hate incident. 
On Jan. 30, the letters KKK were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union womens bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. 
Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. 
Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. 
The people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway, Thomas said. The three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. Were still investigating  what were finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.
The incident Thomas is referring to, the vandalism in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosques door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22. In a university-wide email sent the following day, Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter stated that the crime has caused fear and distress among Davis Muslim community members.
Acts and words of hatred directed toward Muslims as a group is an urgent and growing problem across our society, Hexter said in the email. 
The police department is still unsure if the two on campus incidents are related.
In this political climate, you tend to find a variety of different acts of vandalism, Thomas said. These small acts can become bigger in these sensitive times, and people can react a lot stronger than they would normally.
Andy Fell, associate director of news and media relations at UC Davis, said that the UCDPD has not identified any suspects. 
There are no suspects for either incident, Fell said. They are still being investigated.
Fell said that the theory of an animal dragging and dropping the pork tenderloin is a possibility, but that the investigation is still ensuing. 
That would be a benign explanation, Fell said. Were not able to say anything conclusively at this point. The crime alert we sent out was classified as a hate incident based on the presence of pork outside Muslim students residence.
Dinar Kurji, a second-year religious studies major, believes that the Russell Park incident was targeted towards Muslims to intentionally disparage the community.
I think that act was committed to humiliate a particular sect and to show disrespect, Kurji said.They dont understand that we didnt consume it and that it is not unholy to touch or clean it up. It was done out of ignorance [and] hate and wasnt a positive message."
52,"UC Board of Regents to vote on the appointment later this week
University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced her selection of Gary May as the new UC Davis chancellor on Feb. 21. May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Techs College of Engineering. 
Gary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed, Napolitano said in a press release. He was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe hes the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.
May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on investigative leave last April. Katehi resigned as chancellor in August. 
I could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis, May said in the same press release. UC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.
The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor."
53,"Tighter policies require greater approval of outside jobs
Due to new policies implemented after the investigation of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.
In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.
The new policy requires two levels of review and management approval, a UC report read. In addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.
Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. 
This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehis resignation last year, where she faced a series of controversies including holding seats on two for-profit boards.
Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and womens studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators insurance and hide their mistakes.
Katehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so, Fox said. By them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesnt look bad for the UC as a whole. [] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.
Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.
If Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I dont see whats there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing, Breuninger said. I dont think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there arent conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.
Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.
Everything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC, Fox said. Its embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.
Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.
If the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt, Breuninger said. Their actions are more egregious.
Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.
I dont think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part, Breuninger said. This is something thats in the public eye right now, so I dont have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they wont go straight back to their usual operation."
54,"SR #7 asks university to increase capacity for future campus housing
On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).
Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.
UC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agencys statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project, the notice read. Responses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.
The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.
ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.
Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.
What the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low, Martinez said. So the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times cant find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and its just, its not a good mix when it comes to housing.
UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.
ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.
I definitely think that the issue of housing isnt going away anytime soon, Lee said. The issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, its going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of its population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.
The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasnt always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.
I think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and its not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding, Martinez said. So I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they havent been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.

55,"UC Davis leads in sustainability with largest solar power plant of any university
The University of Californias 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UCs successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.
Were attacking this challenge on multiple fronts  undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change, said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.
The report highlights UC Davis implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.
UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.
Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.
UC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year, Kirk said via email.
Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.
Student activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero, Knox said via email. In 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.
A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. 
Preparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative, Napolitano said in the report.
UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.
Here at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere, Knox said via email. Students can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.
Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.
ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.
UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, which they were supposed to stay under until 2020. 
In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025."
56,"Speakers, including Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, highlight dangers of executive orders for the campus community
In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trumps executive orders on immigration. 
This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to The New York Times.
Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.
Recent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values  values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings, Regulska said. Three recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.
Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.
These three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [] attempt to destroy our community fabric, Regulska said. They also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.
Why are so many who arent directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness? Hexter asked the audience, according to UC Davis Dateline. Part of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are  and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, its difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.
One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trumps executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.
Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students families as well.
Our center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students, Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. Our target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method  they can contact us [] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if youre a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.
While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.
In the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure, Regulska said.
Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally."
57,"Executive order has immediate consequences for UC Davis community
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.
On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled, according to a CNN news report. 60,000 visas were cancelled.
 I am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas, said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his statement to the campus community. This situation touches us closely. 
So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. 
There seems to be some ambiguity as to whether Id be allowed to return, Hamidian said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee.
UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City, said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his message to the community. 
He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.
 Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a masters program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.
On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.
In an interview with ABC News, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.
There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldnt attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home, said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. 
An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now there is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.
The anonymous student also said that there are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.
According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.
Putting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now, White said. Iran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [] dealing with something similar. Weve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships its causing, but its also having broader impacts.
The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations."
58,"Student protesters march from MU flagpole to Mrak Hall
UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale UC-wide day of action, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. 
The students met at the Memorial Union flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. 
Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industrys project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.
This pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River, Ferreyra said. And if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.
The pipelines potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was reported that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. 
It doesnt make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth, said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. 
With President Donald Trumps executive order last month advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administrations stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. 
Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipelines impact on future generations.
This is our world and we borrow the world from the future, Wertheim said.
 The appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability."
59,"Conference entails full day of speakers, panels, student-led discussions
UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. 
After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. 
The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. 
We discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change, Ruttkay said via email.
Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the universitys colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. 
Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. 
It was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences, Olivan said. It definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.
Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as normal, while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. 
Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. 
I had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means, Olivan said. 
Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. 
After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.
We had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful, Ruttkay said. 
Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. 
The students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me, Ruttkay said. I was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health. 
Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. 
Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. 
The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. 
The biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadnt anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times, Chiang said via email.
Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. 
Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. 
A great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy, Olivan said.
Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. 
The biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level, Ruttkay said.
Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. 
Were looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health, Grady said via email. Theres a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus. 
"
60,"Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12
After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.
The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Foods locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joes and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.
I think it affects students for the most part, said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.
Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. 
It saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because its not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together, said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. It was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment. 
However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.
Thats why it closed down  people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase, said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. [Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joes, to grow.
Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. 
Id love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city  its something that we critically need, said Mayor Robb Davis.
And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole."
61,"Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwide
Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthoods in-clinic abortion services. 
What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for womens rights. 
Over 80 individuals RSVPd to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.
This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. 
In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as I stand with Planned Parenthood and not your body, not your business. Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. 
I support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for womens health, said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. It provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.
According to Planned Parenthoods 2014-2015 Annual Report, of the 9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.
A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. 
Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. 
My two daughters go to the clinic, Rodriquez said. Their school is teaching them information about womens health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.
Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, Holy Mary, pray for our sinners.
At UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are not provided.
Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance.

62,"California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City Hall
The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the Davis Joint Unified School District or Yolo County services. 
California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.
The state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the states orders, said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. We are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.
The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. 
Davis Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.
Davis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall, said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. Located at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. 
Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.
That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the citys Historic Resource Management Commission.
While there hasnt been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. 
Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the citys history. "
63,"Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalism
On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.
Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the Islamic faith, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administrations list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.
In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. 
I have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community, said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.
In the wake of a hate crime at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading we support you.
I do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before, Mansuri said. There is no longer this predominating attitude that, well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion.
Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear. 
Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.
There is still a lot of hateful sentiment, Mansuri said. This weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.
On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. 
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned, Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.
On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with very little changes.
Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need."
64,"CalRecycle donates $197,851
The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). 
The funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units, said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. 
With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.
Our parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again, Gilbert said. 
To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. 
In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. 
Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. 
According to the CalRecycle website, During the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744. 
Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. 
Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. 
In the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help, said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview."

66,"Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Sanctuary jurisdiction is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.
The controversial executive order, titled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.
The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Davis explained that the City of Davis sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.
The police will not ask, seek to know, or record someones [immigration] status in any interaction [] This is something that weve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, theyre not fearful of contacting the police, Davis said. 
Davis believes that President Trumps executive order will make cities less safe.
Imagine if youre someone who is brought to this country, and youve been trafficked and youre not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trumps executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward, Davis said.
According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.
Our police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way were acting, Davis said. We dont have any concerns about the administrations threats [] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke. Were not in a position where were going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.
Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.
Whether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, hes the President of the United States. Its the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with no, were not going to pass any of his bills [] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible, Casas said.
Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.
For somebody to come around asking random questions like Hey, are you a citizen here? Its kind of none of their business. If theyre doing nothing wrong, then it shouldnt be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. Im completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city, Angel-Gonzalez said.
Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 drivers license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California drivers license without proof of legal residence. 
The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.
The legality of President Trumps executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order."
67,"Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crime
Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism case, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. 
The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, Soon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism. 
Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelhos arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. 
The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. 
Video footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle, said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.
Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. 
Political, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes, said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. 
 Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. "
68,"Davis residents create financial model to make citys financial state more transparent
To increase transparency between the citys financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. 
Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. 
City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the citys potential financial position over the long term, Stachowicz said in an email interview. We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.
Project Toto complements the citys effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the citys financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.
The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the citys financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments
This really isnt a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions, Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?
Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. 
The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.
Its a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation, Mayor Robb Davis said. You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.
Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the citys finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. 
There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. 
Its something I have been very much supportive of, Davis said. Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation."

70,"Davis Cemetery District hosts fundraiser with potted plants
Who said that Valentines Day is limited to young lovers? This Valentines Day, the Davis Cemetery District will allow friends and family to place orders for potted plants to put on the graves of those who are buried there. 
The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. 
Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. 
I like the idea of the fundraiser, Wilson said. I think its a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentines Day when I was younger.
Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentines Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentines Day  red. 
Each arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love, said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a news release.
Since 1855, the Davis Cemetery District has provided a space to honor those who have passed. They now have one of Californias newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. 
According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum website, the art gallery is one of the finest premier art galleries in Northern California, featuring monthly shows by international, national, regional and local artists.
This Valentines Day, make it a goal to spend time not only with that special someone, friends, family or whomever it might be, but also to remember those who have passed. "
71,"Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimers patients at Yolo Hospice
After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimers or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.
In order to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.
The grant was wonderful and very generous, said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. It does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.
Patients with Alzheimers or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesnt affect patients ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.
You figure out an individuals specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre, said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. Its more about them connecting to their past in their music.
Although music isnt said to be a complete cure for Alzheimers or dementia, it does help bring some of the patients memories back for the time being.
[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed, Johnston said. Medication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life. 
The Music & Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimers or dementia.
Alive Inside is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music & Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. 
There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional donations, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.
The program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods, said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. These personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimers, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories."

73,"Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel
The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.
A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.
In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.
Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.
Janet Foley, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.
In Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls, Foley said. 
This is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think its really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.
Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.
The complaint called into question the city councils decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
We are not opposed to the hotel, said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. Our issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.
BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis leadership. The councils MND called for passive relocation of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.
Passive relocation involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. "
74,"The City of Davis hosts festivities in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day
On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. 
The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.
According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to build a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard. 
Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.
Its an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event, Davis said.
A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. 
In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. Kings beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in todays political environment.
Todays theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action, Lewis said. For, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.
Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic Freedom March through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.
The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its website. "
75,"Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12
After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.
The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Foods locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joes and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.
I think it affects students for the most part, said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.
Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. 
It saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because its not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together, said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. It was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment. 
However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.
Thats why it closed down  people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase, said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. [Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joes, to grow.
Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. 
Id love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city  its something that we critically need, said Mayor Robb Davis.
And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole."
76,"Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwide
Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthoods in-clinic abortion services. 
What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for womens rights. 
Over 80 individuals RSVPd to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.
This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. 
In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as I stand with Planned Parenthood and not your body, not your business. Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. 
I support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for womens health, said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. It provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.
According to Planned Parenthoods 2014-2015 Annual Report, of the 9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.
A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. 
Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. 
My two daughters go to the clinic, Rodriquez said. Their school is teaching them information about womens health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.
Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, Holy Mary, pray for our sinners.
At UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are not provided.
Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance.

77,"California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City Hall
The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the Davis Joint Unified School District or Yolo County services. 
California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.
The state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the states orders, said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. We are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.
The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. 
Davis Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.
Davis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall, said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. Located at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. 
Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.
That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the citys Historic Resource Management Commission.
While there hasnt been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. 
Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the citys history. "
78,"Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalism
On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.
Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the Islamic faith, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administrations list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.
In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. 
I have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community, said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.
In the wake of a hate crime at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading we support you.
I do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before, Mansuri said. There is no longer this predominating attitude that, well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion.
Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear. 
Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.
There is still a lot of hateful sentiment, Mansuri said. This weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.
On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. 
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned, Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.
On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with very little changes.
Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need."
79,"CalRecycle donates $197,851
The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). 
The funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units, said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. 
With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.
Our parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again, Gilbert said. 
To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. 
In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. 
Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. 
According to the CalRecycle website, During the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744. 
Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. 
Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. 
In the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help, said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview."

81,"Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Sanctuary jurisdiction is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.
The controversial executive order, titled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.
The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Davis explained that the City of Davis sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.
The police will not ask, seek to know, or record someones [immigration] status in any interaction [] This is something that weve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, theyre not fearful of contacting the police, Davis said. 
Davis believes that President Trumps executive order will make cities less safe.
Imagine if youre someone who is brought to this country, and youve been trafficked and youre not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trumps executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward, Davis said.
According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.
Our police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way were acting, Davis said. We dont have any concerns about the administrations threats [] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke. Were not in a position where were going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.
Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.
Whether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, hes the President of the United States. Its the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with no, were not going to pass any of his bills [] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible, Casas said.
Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.
For somebody to come around asking random questions like Hey, are you a citizen here? Its kind of none of their business. If theyre doing nothing wrong, then it shouldnt be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. Im completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city, Angel-Gonzalez said.
Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 drivers license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California drivers license without proof of legal residence. 
The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.
The legality of President Trumps executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order."
82,"Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crime
Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism case, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. 
The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, Soon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism. 
Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelhos arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. 
The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. 
Video footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle, said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.
Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. 
Political, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes, said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. 
 Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. "
83,"Davis residents create financial model to make citys financial state more transparent
To increase transparency between the citys financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. 
Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. 
City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the citys potential financial position over the long term, Stachowicz said in an email interview. We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.
Project Toto complements the citys effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the citys financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.
The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the citys financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments
This really isnt a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions, Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?
Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. 
The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.
Its a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation, Mayor Robb Davis said. You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.
Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the citys finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. 
There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. 
Its something I have been very much supportive of, Davis said. Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation."

85,"Davis Cemetery District hosts fundraiser with potted plants
Who said that Valentines Day is limited to young lovers? This Valentines Day, the Davis Cemetery District will allow friends and family to place orders for potted plants to put on the graves of those who are buried there. 
The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. 
Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. 
I like the idea of the fundraiser, Wilson said. I think its a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentines Day when I was younger.
Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentines Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentines Day  red. 
Each arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love, said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a news release.
Since 1855, the Davis Cemetery District has provided a space to honor those who have passed. They now have one of Californias newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. 
According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum website, the art gallery is one of the finest premier art galleries in Northern California, featuring monthly shows by international, national, regional and local artists.
This Valentines Day, make it a goal to spend time not only with that special someone, friends, family or whomever it might be, but also to remember those who have passed. "
86,"Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimers patients at Yolo Hospice
After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimers or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.
In order to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.
The grant was wonderful and very generous, said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. It does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.
Patients with Alzheimers or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesnt affect patients ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.
You figure out an individuals specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre, said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. Its more about them connecting to their past in their music.
Although music isnt said to be a complete cure for Alzheimers or dementia, it does help bring some of the patients memories back for the time being.
[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed, Johnston said. Medication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life. 
The Music & Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimers or dementia.
Alive Inside is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music & Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. 
There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional donations, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.
The program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods, said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. These personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimers, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories."

88,"Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel
The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.
A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.
In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.
Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.
Janet Foley, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.
In Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls, Foley said. 
This is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think its really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.
Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.
The complaint called into question the city councils decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
We are not opposed to the hotel, said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. Our issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.
BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis leadership. The councils MND called for passive relocation of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.
Passive relocation involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. "
89,"The City of Davis hosts festivities in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day
On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. 
The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.
According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to build a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard. 
Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.
Its an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event, Davis said.
A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. 
In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. Kings beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in todays political environment.
Todays theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action, Lewis said. For, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.
Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic Freedom March through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.
The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its website. "
90,"Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12
After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.
The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Foods locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joes and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.
I think it affects students for the most part, said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.
Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. 
It saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because its not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together, said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. It was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment. 
However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.
Thats why it closed down  people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase, said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. [Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joes, to grow.
Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. 
Id love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city  its something that we critically need, said Mayor Robb Davis.
And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole."
91,"Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwide
Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthoods in-clinic abortion services. 
What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for womens rights. 
Over 80 individuals RSVPd to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.
This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. 
In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as I stand with Planned Parenthood and not your body, not your business. Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. 
I support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for womens health, said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. It provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.
According to Planned Parenthoods 2014-2015 Annual Report, of the 9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.
A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. 
Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. 
My two daughters go to the clinic, Rodriquez said. Their school is teaching them information about womens health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.
Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, Holy Mary, pray for our sinners.
At UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are not provided.
Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance.

92,"California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City Hall
The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the Davis Joint Unified School District or Yolo County services. 
California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.
The state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the states orders, said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. We are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.
The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. 
Davis Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.
Davis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall, said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. Located at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. 
Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.
That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the citys Historic Resource Management Commission.
While there hasnt been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. 
Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the citys history. "
93,"Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalism
On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.
Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the Islamic faith, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administrations list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.
In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. 
I have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community, said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.
In the wake of a hate crime at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading we support you.
I do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before, Mansuri said. There is no longer this predominating attitude that, well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion.
Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear. 
Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.
There is still a lot of hateful sentiment, Mansuri said. This weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.
On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. 
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned, Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.
On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with very little changes.
Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need."
94,"CalRecycle donates $197,851
The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). 
The funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units, said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. 
With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.
Our parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again, Gilbert said. 
To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. 
In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. 
Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. 
According to the CalRecycle website, During the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744. 
Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. 
Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. 
In the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help, said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview."

96,"Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Sanctuary jurisdiction is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.
The controversial executive order, titled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.
The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Davis explained that the City of Davis sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.
The police will not ask, seek to know, or record someones [immigration] status in any interaction [] This is something that weve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, theyre not fearful of contacting the police, Davis said. 
Davis believes that President Trumps executive order will make cities less safe.
Imagine if youre someone who is brought to this country, and youve been trafficked and youre not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trumps executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward, Davis said.
According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.
Our police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way were acting, Davis said. We dont have any concerns about the administrations threats [] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke. Were not in a position where were going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.
Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.
Whether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, hes the President of the United States. Its the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with no, were not going to pass any of his bills [] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible, Casas said.
Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.
For somebody to come around asking random questions like Hey, are you a citizen here? Its kind of none of their business. If theyre doing nothing wrong, then it shouldnt be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. Im completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city, Angel-Gonzalez said.
Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 drivers license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California drivers license without proof of legal residence. 
The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.
The legality of President Trumps executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order."
97,"Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crime
Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism case, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. 
The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, Soon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism. 
Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelhos arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. 
The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. 
Video footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle, said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.
Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. 
Political, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes, said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. 
 Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. "
98,"Davis residents create financial model to make citys financial state more transparent
To increase transparency between the citys financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. 
Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. 
City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the citys potential financial position over the long term, Stachowicz said in an email interview. We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.
Project Toto complements the citys effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the citys financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.
The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the citys financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments
This really isnt a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions, Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?
Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. 
The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.
Its a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation, Mayor Robb Davis said. You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.
Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the citys finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. 
There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. 
Its something I have been very much supportive of, Davis said. Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation."

100,"Davis Cemetery District hosts fundraiser with potted plants
Who said that Valentines Day is limited to young lovers? This Valentines Day, the Davis Cemetery District will allow friends and family to place orders for potted plants to put on the graves of those who are buried there. 
The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. 
Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. 
I like the idea of the fundraiser, Wilson said. I think its a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentines Day when I was younger.
Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentines Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentines Day  red. 
Each arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love, said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a news release.
Since 1855, the Davis Cemetery District has provided a space to honor those who have passed. They now have one of Californias newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. 
According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum website, the art gallery is one of the finest premier art galleries in Northern California, featuring monthly shows by international, national, regional and local artists.
This Valentines Day, make it a goal to spend time not only with that special someone, friends, family or whomever it might be, but also to remember those who have passed. "
101,"Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimers patients at Yolo Hospice
After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimers or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.
In order to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.
The grant was wonderful and very generous, said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. It does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.
Patients with Alzheimers or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesnt affect patients ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.
You figure out an individuals specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre, said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. Its more about them connecting to their past in their music.
Although music isnt said to be a complete cure for Alzheimers or dementia, it does help bring some of the patients memories back for the time being.
[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed, Johnston said. Medication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life. 
The Music & Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimers or dementia.
Alive Inside is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music & Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. 
There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional donations, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.
The program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods, said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. These personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimers, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories."

103,"Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel
The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.
A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.
In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.
Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.
Janet Foley, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.
In Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls, Foley said. 
This is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think its really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.
Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.
The complaint called into question the city councils decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
We are not opposed to the hotel, said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. Our issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.
BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis leadership. The councils MND called for passive relocation of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.
Passive relocation involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. "
104,"The City of Davis hosts festivities in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day
On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. 
The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.
According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to build a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard. 
Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.
Its an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event, Davis said.
A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. 
In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. Kings beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in todays political environment.
Todays theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action, Lewis said. For, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.
Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic Freedom March through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.
The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its website. "
105,"Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12
After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.
The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Foods locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joes and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.
I think it affects students for the most part, said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.
Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. 
It saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because its not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together, said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. It was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment. 
However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.
Thats why it closed down  people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase, said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. [Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joes, to grow.
Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. 
Id love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city  its something that we critically need, said Mayor Robb Davis.
And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole."
106,"Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwide
Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthoods in-clinic abortion services. 
What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for womens rights. 
Over 80 individuals RSVPd to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.
This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. 
In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as I stand with Planned Parenthood and not your body, not your business. Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. 
I support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for womens health, said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. It provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.
According to Planned Parenthoods 2014-2015 Annual Report, of the 9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.
A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. 
Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. 
My two daughters go to the clinic, Rodriquez said. Their school is teaching them information about womens health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.
Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, Holy Mary, pray for our sinners.
At UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are not provided.
Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance.

107,"California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City Hall
The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the Davis Joint Unified School District or Yolo County services. 
California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.
The state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the states orders, said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. We are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.
The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. 
Davis Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.
Davis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall, said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. Located at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. 
Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.
That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the citys Historic Resource Management Commission.
While there hasnt been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. 
Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the citys history. "
108,"Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalism
On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.
Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the Islamic faith, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administrations list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.
In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. 
I have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community, said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.
In the wake of a hate crime at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading we support you.
I do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before, Mansuri said. There is no longer this predominating attitude that, well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion.
Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.
Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear. 
Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.
There is still a lot of hateful sentiment, Mansuri said. This weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.
On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. 
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned, Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.
On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with very little changes.
Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need."
109,"CalRecycle donates $197,851
The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). 
The funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units, said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. 
With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.
Our parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again, Gilbert said. 
To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. 
In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. 
Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. 
According to the CalRecycle website, During the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744. 
Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. 
Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. 
In the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help, said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview."

111,"Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Sanctuary jurisdiction is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.
The controversial executive order, titled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.
The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Davis explained that the City of Davis sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.
The police will not ask, seek to know, or record someones [immigration] status in any interaction [] This is something that weve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, theyre not fearful of contacting the police, Davis said. 
Davis believes that President Trumps executive order will make cities less safe.
Imagine if youre someone who is brought to this country, and youve been trafficked and youre not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trumps executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward, Davis said.
According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.
Our police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way were acting, Davis said. We dont have any concerns about the administrations threats [] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke. Were not in a position where were going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.
Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.
Whether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, hes the President of the United States. Its the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with no, were not going to pass any of his bills [] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible, Casas said.
Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.
For somebody to come around asking random questions like Hey, are you a citizen here? Its kind of none of their business. If theyre doing nothing wrong, then it shouldnt be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. Im completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city, Angel-Gonzalez said.
Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 drivers license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California drivers license without proof of legal residence. 
The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.
The legality of President Trumps executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order."
112,"Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crime
Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism case, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. 
The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, Soon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism. 
Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelhos arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. 
The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. 
Video footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle, said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.
Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. 
Political, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes, said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. 
 Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. "
113,"Davis residents create financial model to make citys financial state more transparent
To increase transparency between the citys financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. 
Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. 
City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the citys potential financial position over the long term, Stachowicz said in an email interview. We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.
Project Toto complements the citys effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the citys financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.
The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the citys financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments
This really isnt a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions, Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?
Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. 
The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.
Its a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation, Mayor Robb Davis said. You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.
Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the citys finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. 
There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. 
Its something I have been very much supportive of, Davis said. Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation."

115,"Davis Cemetery District hosts fundraiser with potted plants
Who said that Valentines Day is limited to young lovers? This Valentines Day, the Davis Cemetery District will allow friends and family to place orders for potted plants to put on the graves of those who are buried there. 
The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. 
Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. 
I like the idea of the fundraiser, Wilson said. I think its a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentines Day when I was younger.
Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentines Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentines Day  red. 
Each arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love, said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a news release.
Since 1855, the Davis Cemetery District has provided a space to honor those who have passed. They now have one of Californias newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. 
According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum website, the art gallery is one of the finest premier art galleries in Northern California, featuring monthly shows by international, national, regional and local artists.
This Valentines Day, make it a goal to spend time not only with that special someone, friends, family or whomever it might be, but also to remember those who have passed. "
116,"Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimers patients at Yolo Hospice
After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimers or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.
In order to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.
The grant was wonderful and very generous, said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. It does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.
Patients with Alzheimers or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesnt affect patients ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.
You figure out an individuals specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre, said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. Its more about them connecting to their past in their music.
Although music isnt said to be a complete cure for Alzheimers or dementia, it does help bring some of the patients memories back for the time being.
[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed, Johnston said. Medication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life. 
The Music & Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimers or dementia.
Alive Inside is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music & Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. 
There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional donations, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.
The program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods, said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. These personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimers, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories."

118,"Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel
The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.
A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.
In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.
Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.
Janet Foley, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.
In Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls, Foley said. 
This is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think its really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.
Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.
The complaint called into question the city councils decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
We are not opposed to the hotel, said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. Our issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.
BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis leadership. The councils MND called for passive relocation of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.
Passive relocation involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. "
119,"The City of Davis hosts festivities in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day
On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. 
The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.
According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to build a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard. 
Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.
Its an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event, Davis said.
A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. 
In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. Kings beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in todays political environment.
Todays theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action, Lewis said. For, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.
Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic Freedom March through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.
The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its website. "
